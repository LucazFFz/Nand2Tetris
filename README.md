Computer implementation as described in The Elements of Computing Systems.

Currently, only projects 00 through 05 have been completed. However, I intend to update this repository with the remaining projects as I complete them.

This repository also include a logisim simulation of The Hack Computer for a visual representation along with some simple .asm hack programs.
