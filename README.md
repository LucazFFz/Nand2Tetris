# Nand2Tetris
Computer implementation as described in The Elements of Computing Systems.

Currently, only projects 00 through 05 have been completed. However, I intend to update this repository with the remaining projects as I complete them.

Markup : * Project 0: Introduction
Markup : * Project 1: Boolean Logic
Markup : * Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic
Markup : * Project 3: Sequential Logic
Markup : * Project 4: Machine Language
Markup : * Project 5: Computer Architecture
Markup : * Project 6: Assembler
Markup : * Project 8: VM II: Program Control
Markup : * Project 9: High-Level Language
Markup : * Project 10: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis
Markup : * Project 11: Compiler II: Code Generation
Markup : * Project 12: Operating System

This repository also include a logisim simulation of The Hack Computer for a visual representation along with some simple .asm hack programs.
