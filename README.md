# Nand2Tetris
Computer implementation as described in The Elements of Computing Systems.

Currently, only projects 00 through 06 have been completed. However, I intend to update this repository with the remaining projects as I complete them. All software is written in the C# programming language. 

* Project 0: Introduction
* Project 1: Boolean Logic
* Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic
* Project 3: Sequential Logic
* Project 4: Machine Language
* Project 5: Computer Architecture
* Project 6: Assembler
* Project 8: VM II: Program Control
* Project 9: High-Level Language
* Project 10: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis
* Project 11: Compiler II: Code Generation
* Project 12: Operating System

This repository also includes a logisim simulation of The Hack Computer for a visual representation along with some simple .asm hack programs. There is a file converter called HackFileConverter under the 06 project directory which allows one to easily convert .hack files to .logisim files. These can be imported into Logisim's built-in ROM chips.
